# Test_Data
Chart that display's financial data


The application accompalishies both tasks asked.
 

1) In the server, modify the data slightly before serving it to the front end. Add a 'uuid' field to each record, calculated from other appropriate fields.

 

2) Take the dataset and do something useful with it in the front end UI. Use your imagination and remember we service a latency sensitive industry, so that should be the focus.

 I still have to do some clean, but it does the job for now. Let me know if you have any question.
 
 I will make updates to it soon.
